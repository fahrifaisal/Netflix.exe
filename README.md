# About
Faster Triggerbot ever exist. ehe >< Menyala Abangkuhhh

# How to setup
- Compile python. I use Nuitka
- Start Exe, Start Valorant, go to ingame settings and use purple outline.
- While being in ingame settings go to keybinds and add K as a second shoot keybind.
- By default thumb mouse button is the hotkey, if you have always enabled turn on, use f10 instead.
- Should work

- Additionally you can change the color tolerance, I recommend 20-70, also a delay can be added, => config.json


# FAQ
Can I get banned using this?
- there is always a risk but its very unlikely, i'd recommend compiling the source by yourself though and maybe adding vmp to it

How to make it faster?
- this is already pretty fast but if you'd wish to make it faster you can add DXCAM to it and maybe multithreading, these are the only ways I can think of to make it even faster, additionally this in any native language would be a lot faster already.

Why release this?
- why not
